to create a volume via CLI
docker volume create myvolume-hello

to mount it
docker run -v owasp-hello:<mount-point> ...


docker volume inspect myvolume-hello
docker volume rm owasp-hello 

Why Use Volumes

mount local source code into a running container
improve performance
Data persistence
Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt the contents of volumes, or to add other functionality
New volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container.

NETWORKS
docker network ls 
 docker network inspect bridge

 The output above shows the bridge, host, macvlan, null, and overlay drivers.

bridge: The default network driver. If you don’t specify a driver, this is the type of network you are creating. 
Bridge networks are usually used when your applications run in standalone containers that need to communicate. 
See bridge networks.
host: For standalone containers, remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host, and use 
the host’s networking directly. host is only available for swarm services on Docker 17.06 and higher. 
See use the host network.

overlay: Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together and enable swarm services to communicate with each other. 
You can also use overlay networks to facilitate communication between a swarm service and a standalone container, or between 
two standalone containers on different Docker daemons. This strategy removes the need to do OS-level routing between these 
containers. See overlay networks.

macvlan: Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your 
network. The Docker daemon routes traffic to containers by their MAC addresses. Using the macvlan driver is sometimes the best 
choice when dealing with legacy applications that expect to be directly connected to the physical network, rather than routed 
through the Docker host’s network stack. See Macvlan networks.

none: For this container, disable all networking. Usually used in conjunction with a custom network driver. none is 
not available for swarm services. See disable container networking.

Use docker attach to attach your terminal’s standard input, output, and error (or any combination of the three) to a 
running container using the container’s ID or name. This allows you to view its ongoing output or to control it interactively, 
as though the commands were running directly in your terminal.

docker network create -d bridge --subnet 10.0.0.0/24 my_bridge
docker run -itd --name c2 --net my_bridge busybox sh
docker run -itd --name c3 --net my_bridge --ip 10.0.0.254 busybox sh
docker attach c3

another terminal
docker attach c2
ifconfig
Now we can ping those ping 10.0.0.254

docker network ls 
new bridge was added


There are two ways to create a Docker image!!!:

Via the docker commit command
Via the docker build command with a Dockerfile

docker build -t="fiedietsov/static_web:v1.0" https://github.com/skindar/devops-workshop/raw/master/Dockerfile
check container docker run -d -p 8888:80 abdelhalim/static_web:version_web nginx -g "daemon off;"
docker push fiedietsov/static_web:v1.0

docker run \
  --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
  --volume=/var/run:/var/run:ro \
  --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
  --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
  --volume=/dev/disk/:/dev/disk:ro \
  --publish=8080:8080 \
  --detach=true \
  --name=cadvisor \
  google/cadvisor:latest

  Management Commands:
  checkpoint  Manage checkpoints
  config      Manage Docker configs
  container   Manage containers
  image       Manage images
  network     Manage networks
  node        Manage Swarm nodes
  plugin      Manage plugins
  secret      Manage Docker secrets
  service     Manage services
  swarm       Manage Swarm
  system      Manage Docker
  trust       Manage trust on Docker images
